<a name = "about"></a>
A showcase of flight computer design, debugging, and integration. This project also highlights experience in systems engineering, BLE and WiFi communication, structure design and analysis, trajectory analysis, memory and power constraints, and system configuration management. The primary focus is on designing and developing real-time embedded software for a flight computer and ground station communication, along with debugging and testing the system.
